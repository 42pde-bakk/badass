Bgp At Doors of Autonomous Systems is Simple


### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to expand on the knowledge you have gained through NetPractice. You will have to simulate a network and configure it using GNS3 with docker images.
BGP EVPN is based on BGP (RFC 4271) and its extensions MP-BGP (RFC4760).
BGP is the routing protocol that drives the Internet. Through MP-BGP extensions, it can be used to carry reachability information (NLRI) for various protocols (IPv4, IPv6, L3 VPN and in this case, EVPN). EVPN is a special family for publishing information
about MAC addresses and the end devices that access them..


### General Guidelines
• The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine.

• This project involves using and installing docker as well as GNS3.

• You have to put all the configuration files of your project in folders located at the
root of your repository (go to Submission and peer-evaluation for more information).

The folders of the mandatory part will be named: P1, P2 and P3.


### What you need to do
This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.
It is divided into three parts you have to do in the following order:

• Part 1: GNS3 configuration with Docker.

• Part 2: Discovering a VXLAN.

• Part 3: Discovering BGP with EVPN.
